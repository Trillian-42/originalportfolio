    <p>My name is Wendy Grapentine and I am learning Full Stack Web Development at Coder Camps in Phoenix, AZ.</p>

    <h1>My Background</h1>

    <p>I graduated from Arizona State University in May 2005 with a BA in Education. I am a former K-8 General Music, Choir
        and Guitar Teacher and I taught over 2000 students in the Deer Valley and Peoria Unifed School Districts. The last
        5 years I managed a local mini-storage facility. In addition to being responsible for all aspects of office management
        (leasing, collections calls, auctions etc) I was also responsible for all the site's maintenance and landscaping
        requirements! (By the way, I have used every weedkiller out there on the market and can tell you hands down that
        I recommend Spectricide Extended Control--it is the only one that really works well!)</p>

    <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>

    <p>I love learning new things and am looking to transition into web development as a career.</p>
